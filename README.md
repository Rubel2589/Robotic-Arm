# Hand Gesture Controlled Robotic Arm using Fuzzy Logic
This project presents a novel approach to controlling a robotic arm through hand gestures and finger movements. Leveraging the power of Arduino microcontrollers, flex sensors, and fuzzy logic, this system allows users to intuitively manipulate the robotic arm with precision and ease.
# Key Features
Control the robotic arm using hand gestures and finger movements.
Utilizes flex sensors and MPU-6050 sensor for accurate gesture detection.
Implements fuzzy logic for efficient decision-making in robotic arm movement.
Open-source hardware and software design, making it accessible for further development and customization.
Low-cost materials used for construction, promoting affordability and accessibility.
# Components Required
